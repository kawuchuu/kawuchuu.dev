# Cerium has gone offline permanently as of *July 16, 2018*
**Last updated:** July 16, 2018.

## What will happen to Cerium's development in the coming future?
The current version of Cerium will be discontinued, however once Cerium 3.0 is ready, I'll create a simple program that allows users to self-host Cerium.

## Why make users self-host?
I no longer wish to continue hosting Cerium myself. I've lost all motivation to continue hosting it, so I believe self-hosting is a reliable solution that enables users to host it themselves and add it to their own server without the fear of their messages being logged by a public bot.

## Is there an expected release date?
Currently, there's no set release date. I will keep this page updated however, so check back every so often for updates.

## Thank you so much for the opportunity and support during Cerium's development. I wouldn't have continued development with all your support!
Expect the next release to be the best version yet!
